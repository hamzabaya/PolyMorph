PolyMorph is a desktop application for editing geometric shapes. It allows you to create basic shapes (rectangle, circle, oval, etc.), to choose the color of the drawings, to intersect, unite and subtract 2 or more drawn gemometric shapes. It allows the import and export of drawings as an image (.png) or in a serialized file (.ser).
It also approves remote backup; To save shapes drawn to a remote device as long as the destination device is connected to the same Wi-Fi network as the device you're drawing on.
